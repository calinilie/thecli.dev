In early November 2022, I asked one of my awesome teams to take 3 days out of their week. We traveled to northern Italy and spent time together, walking around Bergamo and Milan. We avoided opening our laptops. 

That was the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. Why did I do it, and how come that the cost was approved? 

## Teams need time to build trust
Trust is an essential part of any strong team. Without trust, communication breaks down and morale suffers. Trust is built through spending time together in real life and sharing personal stories. You can't accomplish either of these things if your team is located in separate cities or countries, so it's imperative that the team makes time to meet in person at least once per quarter (if not more often).

## Discussing values is necessary for a healthy workplace
It's important to have shared values and articulate them. We spent two days walking around the city and discussing our values. As a result, we established a set of team values and principles that everyone committed to.

When there is disagreement about how something should be done or who should do it, we refer back to our values and principles, rendering decision making more efficient. Living and acting in accordance with our values also reinforce the team and company culture.

## The employer should facilitate this, periodically
For distributed teams, it is important they have the resources and support from their employer to effectively communicate and collaborate with one another. Having regular in-person meetings and team-building activities not only helps to foster a sense of cohesion and connection among team members, but also allows for more efficient problem-solving and idea generation. Investing in communication and collaboration for a distributed team ultimately leads to improved productivity, motivation and job satisfaction.

While value attribution can be difficult, the ROI is massive. 

Not everyone is comfortable spending time with their colleagues outside of work and it may not be feasible for some. For distributed teams, it can be even more challenging. Not all can afford to travel and be away from family or other obligations that require their presence at home, but if they can make it work then there are many benefits for both parties.

## Our time in northern Italy
People opened up and shared personal stories. We got to learn about each other. What motivates us, what doesnâ€™t, what ticks us off and what our passions are.

It was a great experience. The weather was mostly sunny, we had delicious coffee, plenty of pizza, and enjoyed some great wine.

## Conclusion
We need to talk more and build stronger relationships with our coworkers. This can be done in many ways, but one of the most effective methods is simply spending time with each other.

In conclusion, it is clear that spending time together as a team is crucial for building trust, discussing shared values, and enhancing team performance. The employer's role in facilitating such activities is vital. By investing in communication and collaboration for a distributed team, we have seen an increase in productivity, motivation, and job satisfaction.
